Every object has an intrinsic lock associated with it.
By convention, a thread that needs exclusive and consistent access to an object's fields has to
acquire the object's intrinsic lock before accessing them, and then release the intrinsic lock when
it's done with them. A thread is said to own the intrinsic lock between the time
it has acquired the lock and released the lock. As long as a thread owns an intrinsic lock, no other thread
can acquire the same lock. The other thread will block when it attempts to acquire the lock.
